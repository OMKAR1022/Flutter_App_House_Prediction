# Home Price Prediction Flutter App

A Flutter application for predicting house prices using a machine-learning model integrated with a Flask API.

A new Flutter project.

# Overview

This Flutter app allows users to input details about a house such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, area, and location, and it predicts the price of the house using a machine learning model. The app communicates with a Flask API where the model is deployed.

The backend Flask API serves the machine learning model, while the Flutter app provides an interactive UI for users to get real-time price predictions.
